You are a senior full-stack developer and solution architect specializing in creating high-impact, interactive websites for mission-driven organizations. Your expertise includes modern front-end frameworks, AI integration, performance optimization, and accessible design.

Core Objective:
Generate a comprehensive, step-by-step technical plan and production-ready code to build a website for '4S (Sub-Saharan Sustainability Solutions)'. The website must be a visually stunning, highly functional digital platform that effectively communicates their unique value proposition and converts visitors into stakeholders.

Project Specifications:

1. Strategic Framework & Core Requirements:

Primary Goals:

Clearly showcase the unique value prop: "AI + opportunity-driven sustainability in Africa."

Drive conversions from key audiences: investors, government partners, and NGOs.

Use interactive elements to simplify complex topics (SDGs, climate resilience).

Mandatory Technical Features:

AI Integration: An interactive "Impact Calculator" and a "Solution Matchmaker" quiz.

Gamification: A badge system for user engagement.

Performance: A dedicated 'Low-Bandwidth Mode' for users with poor connectivity.

Accessibility: Full WCAG compliance, including voice search functionality.

Dynamic Content: A filterable, tag-based portfolio (by SDG, country, tool).

2. Design & User Experience (UX) Mandates:

Visual Identity:

Color Palette: Implement a defined scheme of earthy greens, tech blues, and warm ochres.

Typography: Use a modern sans-serif (e.g., Gilroy) paired with an Afro-centric accent font for headings.

Imagery: Design must blend authentic photography of African entrepreneurs with digital/AI visual overlays.

Interactivity:

Implement a custom AI chatbot named "SustainaBot".

Create a "Build Your Solution" drag-and-drop sandbox module.

Include a real-time, data-fed "SDG Tracker" dashboard.

Use scroll-triggered animations (e.g., landscape morphing) and subtle hover effects (e.g., buttons with sprouting seed animations).

3. Detailed Page-by-Page Breakdown:
Provide code and architecture for the following pages:

Homepage: Hero section with a full-screen, loopable background video/animation. Must contain the bold tagline “AI-Powered Sustainability for Africa’s Green Revolution” and two primary CTA buttons: “Explore Our Solutions” and “Partner With Us”.

The 4S Difference Page: Features an interactive slider ("Challenges → Opportunities") and the core AI Impact Calculator (user-input parameters yield potential SDG outcomes).

Solutions Page: A filterable grid system (filters: SDG, Country, Tool). Includes the AI Solution Matchmaker quiz.

Theory of Change Page: A vertical, scroll-triggered animated roadmap illustrating the Diagnose → Innovate → Scale → Sustain model. Includes embedded video players for mini-documentaries.

Investor Hub Page: Features a live "Opportunity Pipeline" dashboard and a repository of downloadable, country-specific SDG Investment Briefs (PDFs).

Blog/Insights Page: With a tagged article system and embedded interactive maps displaying Sub-Saharan climate data.

4. Technical Stack Recommendations:

Frontend: React.js/Next.js for component-based structure, server-side rendering, and optimal performance.

Styling: Tailwind CSS combined with Framer Motion for advanced animations.

Backend: A headless CMS (e.g., Strapi or Contentful) for easy blog/portfolio management.

AI Features: Integrate via API calls to a dedicated AI service (e.g., OpenAI API for the chatbot and quiz, custom Python backend for the Impact Calculator).

Maps: Use a library like Leaflet.js or D3.js for custom, interactive data visualizations.

5. Deliverables Format:
Provide the response in the following structure:

Phase 1: Project Architecture & Setup

Recommended folder structure.

package.json with all necessary dependencies.

Phase 2: Core Component Development

Clean, commented code for each major page and interactive component (Hero, Calculator, Quiz, Filterable Portfolio, etc.).

Separate code for reusable components (Header, Footer, VideoPlayer).

Phase 3: AI Integration & Advanced Features

Pseudocode or example code for integrating the AI APIs (Impact Calculator logic, chatbot dialog flow).

Implementation strategy for the low-bandwidth mode (e.g., conditional image loading, disabling heavy animations).

Phase 4: Content Population & Polish

Instructions for connecting the headless CMS.

Code for the scroll-triggered animations and micro-interactions.

Tone & Style:
The generated code must be professional, clean, well-commented, and adhere to modern best practices for security, SEO, and accessibility.
